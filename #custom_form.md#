# Custom Payment Forms

Until now we've been using Stripe's excellent `checkout.js` that provides a popup iframe to collect credit card information, post it to Stripe and turn it into a `stripeToken` and then finally post our form. There's something conspicuously absent from all of this, however. Remember how Sale has an email attribute? We're not populating that right now because `checkout.js` doesn't easily let us add our own fields. For that we'll need to create our own form. Stripe still makes this easy, though, with `stripe.js`.

## Form HTML

Here's the form we'll be using:

```erb
<%= form_tag buy_path(permalink: @product.permalink) do %>
  <span class="payment-errors"></span>
  <div class="form-row">
    <label>
      <span>Email Address</span>
      <input type="email" name="email" />
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-row">
    <label>
      <span>Card Number</span>
      <input type="text" size="20" data-stripe="number" />
    </label>
  </div>

  <div class="form-row">
    <label>
      <span>CVS</span>
      <input type="text" size="3" data-stripe="cvc" />
    </label>
  </div>

  <div class="form-row">
    <label>
      <span>Expiration (MM/YYYY)</span>
      <input type="text" size="2" data-stripe="cvc" />
    </label>
  </div>

<% end %>
```
