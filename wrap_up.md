# Additional Resources

Hopefully this guide has given you a good overview of working with Stripe with Rails and the tips and hints I've given have been helpful. What follows is a list of links to additional resources that I've found very helpful to my Stripe implementations.

## Documentation

* [Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs) is truly excellent. If some question isn't answered in this book that should be the first place you look.
* [Stripe Ruby API Docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/ruby): The Ruby API has it's own documentation mini site
* [Stripe Ruby API code](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby): The ruby API is open source and is a pretty good read. If you're looking to build a comprehensive HTTP API in Ruby you should definitely model it on this.

## Examples

* [Rails Stripe Membership SaaS](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-stripe-membership-saas/) is a comprehensive example of a Stripe membership integration.
* [RailsApps](http://railsapps.github.io) is great collection of example Rails apps in general.
* [Working with Stripe Payouts](http://blog.chriswinn.com/working-with-stripe-payouts) is a short article about integrating Stripe Payouts into your rails app

## Libraries

* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), a Rails authentication library
* [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan), a Rails authorization library
* [jQuery Payment](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment) is a very useful set of jQuery functions for working with payment fields

## Books

* [The Tangled Web](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/tangled/) is a guide to web security and how crazy the internet really is. Not directly applicable to a Stripe/Rails integration but it is a great read and is full of useful tips and explanations. Highly recommended.
