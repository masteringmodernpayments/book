# The Simplest Stripe Integration

This chapter is going to be a whirlwind integration with Stripe. It's going to be simple and nothing you haven't seen before, but it'll give us something to build on for the next few sections.

## Basic Setup

First, add the Stripe gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stripe', git: 'https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby'
```

And then run `bundle install`.

We'll also need to set up the Stripe keys:

```
# in config/initializers/stripe.rb
Rails.configuration.stripe = {
  publishable_key: ENV['STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'],
  secret_key: ENV['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'],
}

Stripe.api_key = Rails.configuration.stri

## Controller

Next, let's create a new controller named `Transactions` where our Stripe-related logic will live:

```bash
$ rails generate controller transactions
```
