# Building Artifacts

Note: none of this is actually implemented yet.

Desired artifacts:

* Website (actually an app where users can login and search and view the guide)
* Downloadable HTML
* PDF
* Mobi
* ePub

Implementation details

* Use a Rails app that includes the sales engine to actually sell access to the guide
* App deploy checks out the latest version of the guide, does document conversion
