## Colophon

This book is typeset using [Lora][colophon-Lora] for body text, [Droid Sans][colophon-Droid Sans] for headers, and [Inconsolata][colophon-Inconsolata] for code, all from [Google Web Fonts][colophon-Google Web Fonts]. Initial production happened in Emacs using Markdown for basic formatting. Final production uses a toolchain involving Rake and [Docverter][colophon-Docverter], the author's open source document conversion service.
