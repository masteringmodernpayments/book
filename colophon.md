## Acknowledgements

Thank you to my fiance Emily for putting up with this wacky project. Thanks to Nathan Barry for writing [Authority][colophon-Authority] and inspiring me to write in the first place. [Matt Vanderpol][colophon-Matt] sent in dozens of spelling and grammar corrections, content ideas, and bug reports and was overall an awesome resource. Finally, thank you to all of the people who preordered and sent me questions and comments.

## Colophon

This book is typeset using [Lora][colophon-Lora] for body text, [Droid Sans][colophon-Droid Sans] for headers, and [Inconsolata][colophon-Inconsolata] for code, all from [Google Web Fonts][colophon-Google Web Fonts]. Initial production happened in Emacs using Markdown for basic formatting. Final production uses a toolchain involving Rake and [Docverter][colophon-Docverter], the author's open source document conversion service.
